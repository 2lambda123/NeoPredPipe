## Summary

Post netMHCpan predictions, this pipeline allows you to perform neoantigen recognition potential predictions as described by [Marta Luksza et al., Nature 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24473).
This can only be done after following the procedure outlined [here](README.md), but a suitably formatted input would suffice.

## Dependencies
###### Note: Should be compatible on Darwin and Linux systems, not Windows.

Besides the dependencies outlined [here](README.md), the following are required for neoantigen recognition potential predictions.

1. [NCBI BlastX+](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download)
   - Fully install NCBI BlastX+ as per NCBI's instructions

## Building Dependencies
```bash

```

## Running the model
```bash
python ./NeoRecoPo.py
```
1. asdf
   - lorem ipsum and so on.
