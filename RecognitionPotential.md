## Summary

Post netMHCpan predictions, this pipeline allows you to perform neoantigen recognition potential predictions as described by [Marta Luksza et al., Nature 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24473).
This can only be done after following the procedure outlined [here](README.md), but a suitably formatted input would suffice.

## Dependencies
###### Note: Should be compatible on Darwin and Linux systems, not Windows.

Besides the dependencies outlined [here](README.md), the following are required for neoantigen recognition potential predictions.
